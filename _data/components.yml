    LumenCube is my (mediachicken) pet project, on which
    I'm the sole developer.

    I've been slowly but surely developing this in my free time
    for literally years. I hope one day I'm actually able
    to release my pet into the zoo of games that exist in
    this world of ours. But until that day comes, it will
    remain as another large directory on my hard drive.
